# copy-twitter
In this project, i tried to make a copy of Twitter. It was an exercise to practice tools as HTML and CSS. It is not responsive yet, but i'm working on it.

I've been studying programming for 1 month and a half, and this was the first project I did completely alone. In some moments 
I used flex box, but I'm still working to develop myself more and more in this tool. I will continue to update as there are changes.
